-- Ruby Stuff
Welcome aboard
You're riding Ruby on Rails!
About your application's environment

Getting started
Here's how to get rolling:

Use rails generate to create your models and controllers
To see all available options, run it without parameters.

Set up a default route and remove public/index.html
Routes are set up in config/routes.rb.

Create your database
Run rake db:create to create your database. If you're not using SQLite (the default), edit config/database.yml with your username and password.


# Creating A Web Application

request / response cycle; we need four parts to build a Rails app - a model, a route, a controller, and a view.

rails new WebAppName
bundle install

rails generate model NameHere
db/migrate/
	change method
		t.text :content
	
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
