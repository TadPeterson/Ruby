hash.each do |key, value|
  puts key
  puts value
end





puts "Hello there!"
greeting = gets.chomp

# Add your case statement below!
case greeting
    when "English" then puts "Hello!"
    when "French" then puts "Bonjour!"
    when "German" then puts "Guten Tag!"
    when "Finnish" then puts "Haloo!"
    else puts "I don't know that language."
end



It this case it is strictly a method naming convention. There is no enforcement of a boolean return value. 
Just because the method name ends in a question mark doesn't mean that the method must return a boolean, 
but it most definitely should return a boolean. However there are several other uses of 
the ? in Ruby (is a ternary operator, converting a character to its ASCII integer, usage in test, 
in RegEx'es, etc.) many of which are covered in the other answers here.
