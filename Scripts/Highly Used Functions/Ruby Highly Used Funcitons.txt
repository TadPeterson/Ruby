# Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas Explained
Blocks
A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. 
It's not an object on its own, but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.

Proc
A proc is a saved block we can use over and over.

Lambda
A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments it gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.
